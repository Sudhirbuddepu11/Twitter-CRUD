I have created a sample signup or register form for twitter.
I have considered 5 parameters to create account in twitter for a new user.
parameters that i have considered are:-user age, user gender, user name, user mail, mail password.
I HAVE CREATED A CLASS NAME TWITTER. and created E1 as object of twitter.
i have used command line inputs that means inputs from user technique.
i have generated a MENU bar with 5 options they are:-
press 1 to creat twitter account
press 2 to view profile
press 3 to update twitter profile
press 4 to retrive particular information
press 5 to delete details of particular account
press 6 to exit
user can select any number and that number stored in "n" variable of int data type.
Now i have generated if-else loop for each of function mentioned in above menue.
now i have created a data structure name "DATA" to store details of all twitter users.
we can retrive,update,delete,and can exit.

sample input:-
----------------MENU---------------
